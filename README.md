## What I learned
* There are many challenges that require walking away from for a while. Sometimes looking right into something in front of your face is easier seen away from it.
* Time and good practice will improves ones ability to increase proficiency.
* Computer thinks inside the box. which means outside the box thinking must be redefined in a way the computer understands.
* Code is more often read than written
* Computer is never wrong, just the author of the code.
